    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A pancake, also known as a hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk, and butter, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in prehistoric societies.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a></p>
